# README

Part of the odin project. This project was mainly to learn active record associations. This is also the first project I've used a postgre development database with as well. I've found in the worst case, going back to raw SQL first and then trying to figure out how best to get rails to achieve the same result is very helpful. I had to do this to build a scope to provide all events that a user had been invited to.
